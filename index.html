      <h1>Retinol 101 – What It Is and How It Works</h1>
      <p>
        Retinol is a form of vitamin A. When you put it on your skin, enzymes slowly convert it into
        <strong>retinoic acid</strong> – the active molecule that tells skin cells to behave in a “younger”
        way: divide more efficiently, make more collagen, and shed old cells more evenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this process takes time, retinol is usually <em>less irritating</em> than prescription
        tretinoin, but it can still cause dryness and peeling when used too fast.
      </p>

      <h2>What retinol can realistically do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Smooth uneven texture and fine lines over several months.</li>
        <li>Help fade mild hyperpigmentation and post-acne marks.</li>
        <li>Reduce clogged pores and some types of acne.</li>
        <li>Strengthen the deeper layers of the skin when used consistently.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What retinol cannot do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Replace SPF – you still need daily sunscreen.</li>
        <li>Completely erase deep wrinkles or sagging skin.</li>
        <li>Work overnight – results are measured in months, not days.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>Retinol vs Retinal vs Tretinoin</h2>
      <p>
        All three are vitamin A derivatives, but they sit at different points in the conversion chain
        to retinoic acid.
      </p>

      <h3>Cosmetic retinol</h3>
      <p>
        Needs two conversion steps to become retinoic acid. This makes it slower and generally gentler.
        Ideal for beginners and long-term maintenance.
      </p>

      <h3>Retinal (retinaldehyde)</h3>
      <p>
        Needs only one conversion step, so it is more potent at the same percentage.
        Good for people who already tolerate retinol and want a bit more power without going
        straight to prescription.
      </p>

      <h3>Tretinoin (retinoic acid)</h3>
      <p>
        Prescription-only in many countries. It is already in the active form and works faster,
        but also has a higher risk of irritation. Best used under medical supervision.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Start a Beginner Retinol Routine</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest mistake people make is doing too much, too soon. Here is a simple, conservative
        way to start if you have generally healthy skin:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Cleanse with a mild, non-foaming cleanser and gently pat skin dry.</li>
        <li>Wait until the skin is completely dry (at least 10–15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Apply a pea-sized amount of retinol to the whole face, avoiding eyes and corners of the nose.</li>
        <li>Follow with a simple, fragrance-free moisturiser.</li>
        <li>Start with 2 nights per week for at least 2–3 weeks before increasing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you are very nervous or prone to irritation, you can “sandwich” retinol between two layers
        of moisturiser or apply it only once per week at first.
      </p>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>Side Effects and When to Stop</h2>
      <p>
        Mild dryness, tightness and light flaking are common when you first start retinol. These are
        usually manageable if you slow down and moisturise more.
      </p>

      <h3>Signs you are overdoing it</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Burning or stinging that lasts more than a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Red, shiny, “plastic” looking skin.</li>
        <li>Cracked corners around the nose, mouth or eyes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you see any of these, stop retinoids completely until your skin feels normal again.
        Switch to a basic routine: gentle cleanser, bland moisturiser, sunscreen.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Should Be Careful or Avoid Retinol?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pregnant or breastfeeding people (talk to your doctor first).</li>
        <li>Those with uncontrolled eczema, rosacea or very reactive skin.</li>
        <li>Anyone using strong prescription treatments like oral isotretinoin.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In these cases, it is safer to work with a dermatologist who knows your skin and medical
        history rather than self-experimenting.

      <h3>Can I use retinol around my eyes?</h3>
      <p>
        Some people tolerate retinol around the eyes, others do not. If you try it, start by using
        a tiny amount over a layer of eye cream and only once per week. Dedicated eye products with
        milder retinoids are often safer.
      </p>

      <h3>Can teenagers use retinol?</h3>
      <p>
        Teens with acne are more often prescribed adapalene or tretinoin under medical supervision.
        Cosmetic retinol is usually not necessary unless recommended by a professional.
      </p>

      <h3>Is “purging” normal?</h3>
      <p>
        Retinoids can speed up how quickly clogged pores come to the surface, which may look like more
        breakouts in the first weeks. This should calm down over time. If breakouts are widespread,
        painful or last for months, talk to a dermatologist.
