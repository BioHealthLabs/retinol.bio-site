      <h2>Retinol 101 – What It Is and How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Retinol is a form of vitamin A. Once applied to the skin, enzymes slowly convert it into
        <strong>retinoic acid</strong> – the active molecule that tells skin cells to behave in a more
        “youthful” way: divide more efficiently, make more collagen, and shed old cells more evenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this conversion takes time, cosmetic retinol is usually <em>less irritating</em> than
        prescription tretinoin. But it can still cause dryness, peeling and burning when introduced too
        aggressively.
      </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Smooth mild uneven texture and fine lines over months.</li>
            <li>Help fade post-acne marks and some types of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>Support collagen in deeper layers of the skin with consistent use.</li>

          <h3>What retinol cannot do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Replace sunscreen – UV protection is still essential.</li>

    <!-- RETINOL VS RETINAL VS TRETINOIN -->
    <section id="compare-options" class="card">
      <h2>Retinol vs Retinal vs Tretinoin</h2>
      <p>
        All three are vitamin A derivatives, but they sit at different points in the conversion chain
        to retinoic acid. The closer you are to retinoic acid, the faster – and often harsher – the effect.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Cosmetic retinol</h3>
          <p>
            Needs two conversion steps to become retinoic acid. This makes it slower and generally
            gentler. Ideal for beginners and long-term maintenance when combined with SPF.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Retinal (retinaldehyde)</h3>
          <p>
            Needs only one conversion step, so it is more potent at the same percentage.
            A good option for people who already tolerate retinol and want slightly faster results
            without jumping straight to prescription-only treatments.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-card">
          <h3>Tretinoin</h3>
          <p>
            Prescription retinoic acid. Works directly at the receptor level, so it can bring visible
            changes faster – but with a higher risk of irritation. Best used under medical supervision.

    <!-- ROUTINE -->
    <section id="routine" class="card">
      <h2>How to Build a Beginner-Friendly Retinol Routine</h2>
      <p>
        Most barrier problems come from doing too much, too soon. A conservative, clinical approach
        will usually get you further than “max strength from day one”.
      </p>

      <ol class="numbered">
        <li><strong>Prepare:</strong> cleanse with a mild, non-stripping cleanser and gently pat dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Wait:</strong> allow skin to dry completely (10–15 minutes) to reduce stinging.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply:</strong> use a pea-sized amount for the whole face, avoiding eye area and
            corners of nose and mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Seal:</strong> follow with a simple, fragrance-free moisturiser.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> start with 2 nights per week for at least 2–3 weeks before
            increasing.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Very reactive or nervous? Use the “sandwich method” – moisturiser → small amount of retinol →
        another layer of moisturiser – or start with once weekly.

    <section id="risks" class="card">
      <h2>Side Effects and When to Stop</h2>
      <p>
        Mild dryness, tightness and light flaking are common when you first introduce retinol. These
        can usually be managed by reducing frequency and moisturising more.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>Often manageable</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Slight dryness or tight feeling.</li>
            <li>Light flaking around nose and mouth.</li>
            <li>Small breakouts (“purging”) in congested areas.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>Warning signs – pause use</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Burning or stinging that persists more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Red, shiny “plastic” looking skin.</li>
            <li>Cracks and soreness around eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you see warning signs, stop all retinoids until your skin feels normal again. Simplify your
        routine to a gentle cleanser, bland moisturiser and daily sunscreen.

    <!-- WHO SHOULD BE CAREFUL -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Who Should Be Extra Careful or Avoid Retinol?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pregnant or breastfeeding people – always discuss vitamin A products with your doctor.</li>

    <!-- FAQ BLOCK -->
    <section id="faq" class="card faq">
      <h2 class="section-title">Retinol FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Can I use retinol around my eyes?</h3>
      <p>
        Some people tolerate retinol around the eyes, others do not. If you try it, start by applying
        a tiny amount over a layer of eye cream, once per week. Dedicated eye formulas with milder
        retinoids are often safer.
      </p>

      <h3>Can teenagers use retinol?</h3>
      <p>
        Teens with acne are more often prescribed adapalene or tretinoin under medical supervision.
        Cosmetic retinol is usually not necessary unless a professional recommends it.
      </p>

      <h3>Is “purging” normal?</h3>
      <p>
        Retinoids can speed up the life cycle of clogged pores, which may temporarily increase
        breakouts in the first weeks. This should gradually calm down. If breakouts are widespread,
        painful or continue for months, see a dermatologist.
